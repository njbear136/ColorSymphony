Color Symphony is an interactive web art experience where colors come to life through music. As you draw on the digital canvas, each color category triggers a unique background song. ColorCanvas is an interactive web app that lets you draw freely on a digital canvas while each color you choose plays its own song. It combines creativity and sound, turning every stroke into a part of your own musical artwork. The app is built using React and Vite, ensuring smooth performance and a fast, responsive experience as you paint and experiment.

The app includes six main assigned colors: red, pink, green, dark blue, sky blue, and purple, each connected to a unique audio track. As you draw with a color, its assigned song begins to play, creating a dynamic connection between visuals and music. Stopping your brush pauses the sound, while clearing the canvas restarts all songs, allowing you to start a brand-new musical artwork from scratch. For the other colors, a default song plays.
